# Touchstone Folder

This is the folder that will be searched for the Touchstone (.s4p) files specified in configurations. There is no need to specify this folder when setting a filename. E.g. if one wants to use "A.s4p" from this folder as the through channel then use the following setting in the function:

`simSettings.channel.fileNames.thru = 'A.s4p'`
